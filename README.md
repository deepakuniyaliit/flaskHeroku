# Rest Api Flask

This flask repository will cover the basic Flask concepts beginning with installation. Using this guide you can go through the programs and read their meaning in comments which will help you to understand the concepts in a better and clear way. Most of the comments and programs I will write here will be coming from various sources on the Internet and my own understanding about those tutorials.

## Instructions to begin with Flask.

1. Install Flask by using the following command - ```pip3 install Flask```
2. Create app1.py as first file, write first app to return "Hello World"
3. Alternatively you can write function to return Hello World! in BOLD, which will show the text in Heading form.
4. Run flask app using - ```python3 app1.py```
5. Copy the IP address - http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on web page (modify the port number accordingly).
6. You have created your very first app in Flask. Congratulations!!!
